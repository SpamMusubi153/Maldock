# Maldock
A Beginner-Friendly Library for Getting Started with Machine Learning Applications

## Have you ever had to step away from your computer in a library, coffee shop, or another type of busy public space?
Did you lock it?

If Your Answer is: ✅, Nice Job!

If Your Answer is ❌, Stay safe!

Unfortunately, a locked computer doesn’t do much to deter someone from grabbing your device and running. Your computer has no way of figuring out what is happening, and calling for help from the people around it.

But now your computer can be **its own** best protector with Maldock!
The moment you step away, Maldock actively scans its surroundings with machine learning and computer vision. It keeps tabs on internal sensor data, and non-obtrusively alerts others that it is monitoring itself. 
The instant something funny happens, Maldock springs your computer into action, setting off a loud siren and flashing lights. It signals to others what is going on, and sends you an update of what is happening.

All of this is done on your device keeping yourself and others private.

## Who are we? && What’s Next for Maldock?
We are a team of Computer Science (CS) students from Seattle University who are interested in computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML). We’ve recently been working on starting A.n.I.Ma.L club (Artificial, and Intelligent Machine Learning Club) to make ML tools more accessible, and raise awareness about how they really work.

Even coming into this project with former machine learning experience, we were surprised at how long it took to put pieces together from scratch. We realized that DubHacks could be an opportunity for us to write wrapper code with reasonable defaults to help get more people started.

While we’ve made a project with Maldock, we intend for the name to become the name of a beginner-friendly library that those looking for exposure to machine learning (such as A.n.I.Ma.L’s new club members) can use to get started. While we’re proud of our final project, our real accomplishment has been our modular code that simplifies the process of playing with pre-trained models for the first time.

We’re looking forward to meeting you, and we’d be happy to talk about any questions or ways you could use this project in your community.

**Go A.n.I.Ma.L!**
